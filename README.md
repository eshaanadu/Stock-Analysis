# Stock-Analysis Project

# Overview
This project provides a Python script that fetches historical stock prices from the Twelve Data API, calculates various technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD, and visualizes the results. Users can generate detailed stock analysis charts and summaries, aiding in better investment decisions and market trend evaluations.

# Design
The design of this project emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, leveraging standard Python libraries to maximize accessibility. I utilized `pandas` for data manipulation, `requests` for API interaction, and `matplotlib` for visualization, ensuring a streamlined workflow for fetching, analyzing, and visualizing stock market data with minimal setup. 

# Methodology
I utilized historical stock price data, including daily closing prices, to calculate key technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD. By applying rolling calculations and exponential smoothing techniques, I derived these indicators to identify market trends and potential trading signals. The processed data was then visualized to provide clear insights into stock performance and trend analysis.
